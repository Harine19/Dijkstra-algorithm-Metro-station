# DijkstraAlgoMetroNetwork
A DSA Project - Using Graph Data structure and Dijkstra Algorithm to solve the 'Shortest route' problem in the Chennai metro network

The problem statement is the difficulty faced by commuters and tourists in finding stations and the most efficient route between two metro stations. This can be challenging, especially in large and complex metro networks, and can result in wasted time, missed appointments, and unnecessary stress. This is a project that utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm and graph theory to predict the number of stations between a source and destination on a metro network. The program provides an accurate prediction of the shortest route to take. This program is written in python and runs on a command line interface.

We have included 33 of the main metro stations in the Chennai Metro Network, part of the green line and blue line.
This application takes the user input of : 
1. The source location
2. The destination location

And provides the user with :
1. The number of stations between the mentioned source and destination
2. The path of the stations from source to destination like : Chennai metro -> Government estate -> LIC 
3. The shortest distace from source to destination in kilometers 

Sample output:
